We should always be ahead of our lawyer
- In information and
- Preparation

Don't expect your lawyer to treat you like a human

They expect to get unlimited credit with limited contribution

There exists nothing called justice, unless you know law.

In my case

-> Patent attorney kept asking money, even after i paid about 1000USD

-> I showed the laws of code of conduct to him

-> Now he is complying

I had already prepared

-> Breach of contract laws

-> Normally, they(lawyers) ask you to get lost

-> If he did that, i will invoke breach of contract

If the lawyer does not comply to client instructions

- I will invoke form-F in patent act -> second schedule

Preparation always helps

-> In dealing with lawyers

-> Then you get confidence
