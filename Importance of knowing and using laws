#### How lawyers work in civil case
Assume you ask for 1 room in a 10 room house
- Your lawyer will draft the case claiming all 10 rooms of the house, including fathers/brothers/ancistors property
- If you ask him to draft to claim only 1 room, your lawyer will ask you to get lost
Exponential increase in dispute
- Now your opposition is father/brother many families of ancistors

Did your lawyer do wrong thing
- No. Your lawyer did the right thing as per law
- The law tells draft claims to give maximum benefit for the client

Who has given this right to lawyer
- The state has given this right to lawyer

Why did the state give this right to lawyer
- When two people fight the third persons and other-parties make profit
- The fight will be intense if each is given more power to fight
- This is the intention of the state
- Hence the lawyer is doing this

Modern legal system
- Is a cock-fight legal system
- You hire cocks (lawyers) to fight
- The strong cock wins the case

Important note in modern legal system
- Your lawyer will always use lies to win in the case
- This is what gives maximum value to state, lawyers
- If you tells truth, your lawyer will not support you


How you will do if did civil case your self
- You will negotiate and take 1 bedroom or 1/2 bedroom or no bedroom
- Here neither state gets money, nor lawyer gets money
- However this is the smart thing to do
- You get peace of mind, you are not exploited
- Neither you are victim or cock fight nor your relatives are victims of cock fight
